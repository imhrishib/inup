                        The Indian Nanoelectronics Users Program (INUP) was conceived and supported by MeitY and the Office of the PSA as an integral part of the initiative of establishing a Centre for Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CEN) at both IISc and IIT Bombay in 2006.
                        It was envisioned that both the nanocenters, built at great expense and staffed with teams of technical experts, should be national centres whose facilities are open to aspiring academic researchers from around the country. Not
                        only would it be very difficult to set up centres everywhere in the country and provide them with required expert staff, but “open national nanocenters” would also inculcate a spirit of collaboration among researchers and raise
                        the efficiency of the nanocenters’ operations by bringing in researchers from elsewhere in the country.

                    </p>

                        A Wider Network

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2">
                        After IISc and IITB, MeitY initiated nanocenters at IIT Madras (IITM) and IIT Delhi (IITD) in 2011, as well as one at IIT Guwahati (IITG) in 2015. The one at IITM focused on Nanomechanical Systems and Nanophotonics, the one at IITD on “Non-Silicon Based
                        Technologies”, while the one at IITG focused on Theranostic Devices with an eye on the unique requirements of the North East of India. In view of the success of the INUP program, there was intent from MeitY and readiness from these
                        nanocenters to also open up their facilities to academic users from across India. In 2018, the nanocenters at IISc, IITB, IITD, IITM, along with the facility at IIT Kharagpur, were brought under one umbrella - the Nanoelectronics
                        Network for Research and Applications (NNetRA) - supported for four years thence by MeitY and DST combined. This collaborative network focuses on translational research in all areas of nanoelectronics, spanning Safety (strategic/security),
                        Healthcare, Energy & Environment, Agriculture, and other topics in Nano. Now, it is proposed to bring all six nanocenters, viz. at IISc, IITB, IITD, IITG, IITKgp and IITM under one umbrella to open up their facilities to the nation,
                        with the benefit of the INUP experience and with support from MeitY. This initiative comes at a crucial moment in the development of India’s ecosystem for Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) as she finally takes concrete
                        steps towards self-reliance (Aatma Nirbhar Bharat) in this critical sector. Importantly, in view of the criticality of capacity building at this time, it is proposed that the initiative be supported under the aegis of the HRD Division
                        of MeitY. The proposal has been revised in accordance with inputs from the Working Group thereof.

                        <p class="mb-5">This new program, <strong>Indian Nanoelectronics Users’ Programme - Idea to
                                Innovation (INUP-i2i)</strong>, proposes to take the ‘open national nanocenters’ concept to the next stage, while retaining the key aspects of training at different levels introduced in INUP. INUP had predominantly provided
                            easy access to state-of-the-art nano fabrication and characterization facilities to researchers across the country, and has thereby created for the first time a critical mass of hands-on experimental researchers across the
                            country in this area.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">It is now time for the broadest leveraging of the facilities and technical expertise at all six institutes to enable their journey towards translation and incubation. This will be facilitated, inter alia, by a centralized portal
                            for INUP-i2i which will channel interested users to the appropriate nano-center and its individual portal based on their preference/s and publicizing through various print & social media about all activities under the programme.
                            Database of Users (i.e. Position held in Academia/Industry/R&D Organization) after INUP training will also be maintained for future references and value addition. The coordination of technical, logistical, and informational
                            activities will be carried out through a centralized Project Management Unit (PMU) to be created by IIT Guwahati.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">Going beyond INUP, INUP-i2i envisions the following new dimensions to training and research facilitation. Firstly, a large fraction of familiarization workshops will be conducted in the virtual mode; this mix will balance the need
                            for wider outreach with the often-inspiring effect of personal interaction. Secondly, hands-on training will see substantial use of digital content prepared under the aegis of INUP-i2i. One common training certificate (bearing
                            name of all six institutions and MeitY), duly signed by all participating agencies and MeitY would be provided to all participants. Thirdly, each of the aforementioned six institutes will act as a hub, with a network of collaborating
                            institutes around it (typically in the same region and/or other under-served regions). We note that the broad and deep institute-to-institute collaboration envisaged here goes beyond the research facilitation of the past through
                            INUP.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-5">The implementing institutes propose to implement formal certification that will maximize its value for the students / trainees. The following options thereof will be studied within the first year. First, certification under the
                            National Skills Qualification Framework will be explored through the relevant agencies. Second, given the implementing institutes’ standing as Institutes of National Importance in the field of HRD with the mandate of floating
                            certified courses and programs, it is also proposed to explore formal certification through internal IISc/IIT channels. [E.g. Continuing Education Programme at IITs that have the mandate of serving the manpower training and
                            knowledge upgradation needs of industry, academia and research organizations, outside of regular degree programs.</p>
                        <p class="mb-5">In addition to support for training and exploratory research, INUP-i2i will incorporate focused support for translational research addressing Grand Challenges of our nation and society. This will comprise the following: identifying
                            promising nanoengineering solutions through Hackathons, supporting innovative R&D projects, facilitating incubation, and incorporating support to startups (including, but not limited to, those incubated out of the nanocenters
                            at these six institutes) by subsidizing their facility usage and providing them networking opportunities with incubators and prototyping centers. It is proposed that in this initial phase of the ‘unified’ program, IISc and
                            IITB would focus more on supporting research projects and startups, while IITD, IITG, IITKgp and IITM will carry forward the training mandate to a somewhat larger degree. The scope of the program is illustrated below.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="mb-5">
                            While innovation and incubation will be a strong focus for the future everywhere, we also note the importance of ensuring that academic research, which forms the basis of patents and subsequently of startups, continues to be supported; and, that the next
                            generation of researchers and innovators are trained. This proposal for INUP-i2i seeks to provide a comprehensive solution for training, research and incubation in nanoelectronics with nation-wide coverage. We seek MeitY’s
                            funding and support for a period of three years at these six institutes. The six institutes are proud to share the goal of expending substantial fractions of the funding serving users from communities that are under-represented
                            (SC/ST) and/or areas that are under-served (e.g. North-East) in the current scenario (the exact fractions for the six institutes are mentioned in their individual proposals).
